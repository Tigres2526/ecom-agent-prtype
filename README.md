## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or later
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- Grok-4 API key
- OpenAI API key (for embeddings)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/dropshipping-ai-agent.git
   cd dropshipping-ai-agent
   ```

2. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/setup.sh
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Or deploy with Docker:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh
   ./scripts/deploy.sh
   ```

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

- `GROK_API_KEY`: Your Grok-4 API key
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for embeddings

### Optional Platform APIs

- Facebook Ads: `FACEBOOK_APP_ID`, `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET`, `FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- TikTok Ads: `TIKTOK_APP_ID`, `TIKTOK_APP_SECRET`, `TIKTOK_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- Google Ads: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN`
- Shopify: `SHOPIFY_API_KEY`, `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET`
- BigCommerce: `BIGCOMMERCE_CLIENT_ID`, `BIGCOMMERCE_ACCESS_TOKEN`

See `.env.example` for all configuration options.

## Usage

### Running a Simulation

```bash
npm run simulate
```

This starts a full dropshipping simulation with the AI agent making autonomous decisions.

### Starting the API Server

```bash
npm run api
```

Access the API at `http://localhost:3000`. See [API Documentation](docs/API.md) for endpoints.

### Web Interface

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access the real-time simulation dashboard.

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
npm test

# Unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Performance benchmarks
npm run test:performance
```

## Development

### Building from Source

```bash
npm run build
```

### Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Project Structure

- **Agent Core**: The main decision-making engine that orchestrates all operations
- **Memory System**: Stores and retrieves past experiences using vector embeddings
- **Tool System**: Modular tools for specific tasks (product research, campaign management)
- **Financial Tracker**: Manages budgets, tracks spending, and prevents bankruptcy
- **Context Manager**: Maintains conversation context within token limits
- **Error Recovery**: Handles API failures with circuit breakers and retry logic

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# With monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana)
docker-compose --profile monitoring up -d
```

### Production Considerations

1. **API Keys**: Ensure all required API keys are properly configured
2. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate memory and CPU limits in Docker
3. **Monitoring**: Enable Prometheus/Grafana for production monitoring
4. **Backups**: Regular backups of logs and audit trail
5. **Security**: Use HTTPS, enable API authentication, and secure your keys

## Monitoring

The agent provides comprehensive monitoring through:

- **Logs**: Structured logging with different levels (logs directory)
- **Metrics**: Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint
- **Audit Trail**: Immutable audit log with hash chain integrity
- **Alerts**: Configurable alerts for critical conditions
- **Web Dashboard**: Real-time status and metrics visualization

## API Reference

The agent exposes a REST API for:

- Starting and stopping simulations
- Monitoring agent status and metrics
- Executing specific actions
- Retrieving logs and audit trails
- Real-time WebSocket events

See [API Documentation](docs/API.md) for detailed endpoint information.

## Safety Features

- **Bankruptcy Protection**: Monitors balance and stops if negative for 10+ days
- **Conservative Mode**: Activates when capital is low
- **ROAS Thresholds**: Minimum 1.5x return required for campaigns
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic recovery from API failures
- **Memory Pruning**: Removes old memories to maintain performance
