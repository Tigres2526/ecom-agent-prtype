# Setting Up Your Private GitHub Repository

## 1. Create a Private Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name it something like `dropshipping-ai-agent`
3. Set it to **Private**
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
5. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Push Your Code

After creating the repo, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add all files to git
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Dropshipping AI Agent with TypeScript fixes

- Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors
- Updated type definitions for proper type safety
- Aligned memory system types
- Fixed Campaign class instantiation
- Updated tool interfaces to match expected structure
- Made private methods public where needed
- Removed unnecessary type casts

# Add your GitHub repo as origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dropshipping-ai-agent.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Alternative: GitHub CLI Method

If you have GitHub CLI installed (`gh`), you can do it all in one go:

```bash
# Create private repo and push in one command
gh repo create dropshipping-ai-agent --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
```
